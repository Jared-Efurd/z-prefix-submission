This app is dockerized.  To run it, cd into this directory (z-prefix-submission), and run the command `docker compose up`.  Once the app initializes, navigate over to 'http://localhost:3000/' in google chrome.  From there, feel free to browse all the items via the 'All Inventories' button located on the top-center of your screen. If you'd like to login or sign-up to become a manager, click the login button in the top-right corner. Sign up if you don't have an account already, navigate to your inventory via the 'My Inventory' button in the top-left corner, and create, read, update, and delete items you've created. Click on an item's trashcan icon to delete it, click anywhere else on the item to view the full details. While viewing the full details if you spot any errors, click the pencil icon to begin making changes in edit mode.
